- Add highlighting for functions, operators, numerics, and labels.

## 0.2.2
- Update tar version.

## 0.2.0
- Function, event, and keyword help is now available when hovering over the item. The profile actually is loaded from the jar, so the

- Initial release of the IDE. The feature list is fairly basic at this point, and only provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and help
topics.
