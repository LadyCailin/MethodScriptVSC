# methodscriptvsc README

This is the official Visual Studio Code IDE for MethodScript. Generally, this code should not be used directly, the extension should be downloaded
directly from the Marketplace. First, download Visual Studio Code, then find the MethodScriptVSC extension.

## Features

The IDE allows you to more easily code in MethodScript. More than just syntax highlighting, the IDE will highlight errors for you as you code, so
you don't need to compile the code just to find out something is wrong. Get information about functions, events, and objects, all without leaving
the IDE. The functions and highlighting are based on your local copy of MethodScript, which will also include help for extensions and whatever
version you're currently running, even if the information on methodscript.com is for another version.

## Requirements

You must be able to run MethodScript from the commandline to get this to work. Java must be installed, and you must have already downloaded the
MethodScript/CommandHelper jar file.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.
